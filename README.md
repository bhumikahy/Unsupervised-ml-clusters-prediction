# Clusters Prediction using Unsupervised Machine Learning

This case study was to predict the optimum number of clusters from the iris dataset using unsupervised machine learning and represent it visually

## What is Unsupervised Machine Learning?
Unsupervised learning is where you only have input data (X) and no corresponding output variables.

The goal of unsupervised learning is to model the underlying structure or distribution of the data in order to learn more about the data.

These are called unsupervised learning because unlike supervised learning there are no correct answers and there is no teacher. Algorithms are left to their own devices to discover and present an interesting structure in the data.
It can be further grouped into clustering and association problems.

Some popular examples of unsupervised learning algorithms are:

k-means for clustering problems.
Apriori algorithm for association rule learning problems.
LDA for topic modeling of text passages, i.e., discover and associate keywords to text.

## Elbow Method
To find the optimum number of clusters we use the elbow method that uses the WCSS (Within Cluster Sum of Squares) concept.
